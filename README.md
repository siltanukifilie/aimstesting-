# Incremental Data Update Pipeline

## Overview

ViralWatch implements an **incremental data update pipeline** to continuously integrate new outbreak information from the **INRB-UMIE/BDBV2026-Data repository**.

Instead of reprocessing the complete outbreak dataset whenever new reports become available, the pipeline identifies only **new or modified records**, applies the existing data-cleaning rules, updates the processed dataset, refreshes the database, and generates new outbreak risk predictions.

This design enables ViralWatch to operate as a **near real-time viral haemorrhagic fever early-warning system**.

# Data Organization

ViralWatch maintains a structured data lifecycle with three main data layers:

```text
data/
│
├── external/
│   └── BDBV2026-Data/
│       └── Original INRB-UMIE outbreak dataset
│
├── raw/
│   └── incoming/
│       └── Newly downloaded outbreak updates
│
└── processed/
    └── outbreak_clean.csv
        └── Analysis-ready outbreak dataset
```

## Data Layer Description

| Data Layer           | Purpose                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data/external/`     | Stores the original outbreak dataset obtained from INRB-UMIE. This source data remains unchanged.  |
| `data/raw/incoming/` | Temporary storage location for newly collected outbreak updates before processing.                 |
| `data/processed/`    | Contains cleaned and validated data used by analytics, machine learning models, and the dashboard. |

# Incremental Update Workflow

## 1. Identify Existing Processed Data

The pipeline first loads the previously processed outbreak dataset:

```
data/processed/outbreak_clean.csv
```

Example:

| Date       | Health Zone | Confirmed Cases | Deaths |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------- | ------ |
| 2026-07-13 | Goma        | 100             | 20     |
| 2026-07-13 | Beni        | 50              | 10     |

The latest processed date is extracted:

```text
Last processed date:
2026-07-13
```

This date is used as the reference point for detecting new outbreak information.

---

# 2. Retrieve Latest Outbreak Data

The pipeline checks the INRB repository for new updates.

```bash
cd data/external/BDBV2026-Data

git pull
```

Example:

Previous dataset:

```
2026-07-13 outbreak report
```

New dataset:

```
2026-07-14 outbreak report
```

Detected update:

```
New records available:
2026-07-14
```

---

# 3. Detect New or Modified Records

The pipeline compares incoming data with the existing processed dataset.

Example implementation:

```python
import pandas as pd

existing_data = pd.read_csv(
    "data/processed/outbreak_clean.csv"
)

latest_data = pd.read_csv(
    "data/external/BDBV2026-Data/latest.csv"
)

last_date = existing_data["date"].max()

new_records = latest_data[
    latest_data["date"] > last_date
]

print(new_records)
```

Output:

```text
New outbreak records:

2026-07-14 | Goma  | 120 cases
2026-07-14 | Beni  | 60 cases
```

---

# 4. Apply Data Cleaning Rules

New outbreak records go through the same preprocessing pipeline used during initial dataset preparation.

Cleaning operations include:

* Standardizing health-zone names.
* Converting date formats.
* Removing duplicate records.
* Handling missing values.
* Correcting inconsistent data formats.

Example:

```python
new_records["health_zone"] = (
    new_records["health_zone"]
    .str.strip()
    .str.lower()
)

new_records["date"] = pd.to_datetime(
    new_records["date"]
)
```

---

# 5. Update Processed Dataset

Cleaned records are merged with historical outbreak data.

```python
updated_dataset = pd.concat(
    [
        existing_data,
        new_records
    ]
)

updated_dataset = updated_dataset.drop_duplicates()
```

Updated dataset:

Before:

```text
2026-07-13 | Goma | 100 cases
```

After:

```text
2026-07-13 | Goma | 100 cases
2026-07-14 | Goma | 120 cases
```

The final dataset is saved:

```python
updated_dataset.to_csv(
    "data/processed/outbreak_clean.csv",
    index=False
)
```

---

# 6. Database Synchronization

After processing, the updated dataset refreshes the ViralWatch database.

```text
Processed Dataset
        |
        ↓
 SQLite Database
        |
        ↓
 FastAPI Backend
        |
        ↓
 Dashboard
```

The database stores:

* Health-zone information.
* Daily outbreak statistics.
* Engineered epidemiological features.
* Model predictions.
* Risk scores.

---

# 7. Machine Learning Prediction Update

Whenever new outbreak data is available:

1. Feature engineering is executed.
2. Machine learning models process updated information.
3. Risk predictions are regenerated.
4. Dashboard indicators are refreshed.

Example output:

| Health Zone | Risk Level |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Goma        | High       |
| Rutshuru    | High       |
| Beni        | Medium     |
| Bukavu      | Low        |

---

# Automated Daily Update

The update pipeline can run automatically using Linux Cron.

Edit scheduled jobs:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add:

```bash
0 8 * * * /home/sitanu/viralwatch/scripts/update_pipeline.sh
```

This executes the update process every day at **08:00 AM**.

Automated workflow:

```text
1. Pull latest INRB outbreak data
2. Detect new records
3. Clean incoming data
4. Update processed dataset
5. Synchronize database
6. Generate risk predictions
7. Refresh dashboard
```

---

# Live Demonstration

For the final demonstration, run:

```bash
./scripts/update_pipeline.sh
```

Expected output:

```text
✓ Checking INRB repository updates
✓ New outbreak records detected
✓ Data cleaning completed
✓ Processed dataset updated
✓ Database synchronized
✓ Risk predictions generated
✓ Dashboard refreshed
```

The dashboard displays updated cross-border outbreak risk information covering:

* North Kivu health zones
* South Kivu health zones
* Border regions connected to Rwanda

---

# Benefits of Incremental Updating

The incremental pipeline provides:

✅ Faster data processing compared with full dataset rebuilding
✅ Continuous outbreak surveillance capability
✅ Reliable handling of changing epidemiological information
✅ Updated machine learning predictions
✅ Near real-time dashboard monitoring
✅ Scalable architecture for future outbreak sources

---

## Summary

The ViralWatch incremental update pipeline creates a reliable bridge between outbreak data collection, machine learning prediction, and public-health decision support.

By continuously integrating new information while preserving historical records, ViralWatch provides an efficient foundation for early detection and cross-border viral haemorrhagic fever monitoring.
